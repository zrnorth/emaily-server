This is a small react/redux application to send out email surveys. It was made to practice React/Redux and integrating various popular APIs.

Sign in using OAuth and make a Stripe "payment" with a fake credit card. Use your acquired credits to send survey emails to a comma seperated list of addresses. The results will show on your dashboard via Sendgrid webhooks.
